-- frame in window function 14 a subset of rows within the partition that
-- determines the scope ot the Window function calculation. The frame is defined
-- using a combination of two Clauses in the Window function: ROWS and BETWEEN.
-- The ROWS clause specifies how many rows should be included in the frame
-- relative to the current row. For example, ROWS 3 PRECEDING means that the
-- frame includes the current row and the three rows that precede it in the partition.
-- The BETWEEN clause specifies the boundaries of the frame.
-- Examples
-- • ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW - means that the
-- frame includes all rows from the beginning of the partition up to and including the
-- current row.
-- ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING: the frame includes the
-- current row and the row immediately before and after it.
-- • ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING: the
-- frame includes all rows in the partition.
-- • ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING: the frame includes the
-- current row and the three rows before it and the two rows after it.

-- SELECT *,
