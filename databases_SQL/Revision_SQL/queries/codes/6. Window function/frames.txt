frame in a window function is a subset of rows within the partiti0ß that
determines the scope of the window function calculation. The frame is defined
using a combination of two clauses in the window function: ROWS and BETWEEN.
The ROWS clause specifies how many rows should be included in the frame
relative to the current row. For example, ROWS 3 PRECEDING means that the
frame includes the current row and the three rows that precede it in the partition.
The BETWEEN clause specifies the boundaries of the frame.
Examples
• ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW - means that the
frame includes all rows from the beginning of the partition up to and including the
current row.
• ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING: the frame includes the
current row and the row immediately before and after it.
• ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING: the
frame includes all rows in the partition.
• ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING: the frame includes the
